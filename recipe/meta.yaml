  summary: 'LHAPDF is a general purpose C++ interpolator, used for evaluating PDFs from discretised data files. '
  description: |
    LHAPDF is a library implementing a standard to represent Parton
    Distribution Functions (PDFs) which is ubiquitous in the field of High Energy
    Physics. PDFs, which describe the structure of the proton, are an essential
    ingredient for experimental and phenomenological studies at the Large Hadron
    Collider (LHC). LHAPDF allows PDF fitting collaborations to distribute their
    results in a format that is interoperable with tools requiring PDFs as input,
    such as Monte Carlo Event generations. The LHAPDF project maintains a remote
    repository of PDFs, which can be installed with tools that accompany the
    library.
